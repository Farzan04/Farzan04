To whom it may concern,

I am writing this letter to express my interest in the Data Scientist position at your company. I had been working as a Data Scientist intern and I understand the key concepts and principles of this job and what it takes to successfully execute all assigned duties.

After working in the data science industry for the past year, I have developed extensive knowledge and expertise in the field and gained valuable experience in various aspects of this job. Besides collecting and examining large datasets, I am fully skilled in creating and implementing professional data forecasting models, producing detailed reports, and performing multiple data management tasks. Moreover, my last internship have helped me to develop and significantly improve my attention to detail and accuracy and gave me a chance to see and feel what it's like to be a part of a deadline-driven and fast-paced business environment.

In addition to my experience, I can offer your firm excellent analytical skills and important multitasking and time management abilities. Not only they are necessary for the job but also serve as an evidence of a data-driven mindset which I believe I possess. I understand that the candidate's education is an important part of the position and therefore it's my pleasure to tell you that I'm a B.Tech graduate and have Professional Certificates in Data Science, Machine Learning with Python.

I am very passionate about my job and, with my great determination and results-oriented approach, I believe I can contribute to the ASRTech, Inc. You can find more information about my career life and personality in the attached resume. 

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
